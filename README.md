  Summer Training Program on Blockchain in collaboration with Metacrafters by Chandigarh University
</h1>

<p align="center">
  Welcome to my Training Program repository for the Summer Training at Chandigarh University on June-July 2023. Throughout this training, I have learned various concepts and technologies related to blockchain and implemented a project that showcases my skills and knowledge.
</p>
  
# Description üé≤
This repository contains the code and resources for my training program, allowing you to explore the exciting world of blockchain technology and view the project I have developed. I have gained hands-on experience with Ethereum, Solidity, JavaScript, and other tools to develop a **Social Network Application using Blockchain**. Additionally, I have acquired NFTs that represent my achievements in this training program.

## Course Overview üß©

The Training consists of four Courses:

### üü¢ Course 1: JS PROOF: Beginner Course

This module focuses on building a solid foundation in JavaScript. It covers the following topics:

- **Module 1.1: JavaScript Variables and Operators**
  - Foundational coding knowledge in JavaScript, including variables, data types, operators, and basic calculations.

- **Module 1.2: JavaScript Arrays and Objects**
  - Working with arrays and objects in JavaScript, understanding their properties and methods, and manipulating data using these data structures.

- **Module 1.3: JavaScript Loops and Functions**
  - Utilizing loops and functions to iterate over data and perform repetitive tasks in JavaScript.

üöÄ For more details, you can visit the **[JS PROOF: Beginner Course](https://academy.metacrafters.io/courses/javascript)** on MetaCrafters Academy.

### üü° Course 2: ETH PROOF: Beginner Course

This module introduces you to Ethereum and the fundamentals of blockchain technology. It consists of the following modules:

- **Module 2.1: Getting Started with Web3 and the Blockchain**
  - Defining Web3, the blockchain, cryptography, and Ethereum. Understanding the basics of interacting with the Ethereum network.

- **Module 2.2: Ethereum and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**

    npm install
    ```

3. Navigate to the relevant module's folder (e.g., js-proof, eth-proof, etc.).
4. Se up environment variables and update configuration files.
5. Compile the smart contracts:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

6. Deploy the smart contracts:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat deploy
    ```
7. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
8. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
